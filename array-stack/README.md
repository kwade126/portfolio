## Array Stack

**The Assignment:**

Using your knowledge of collections, you will be 
creating a Stack that is powered by an array instead of
a list. 

- Call your class ArrayStack
- Works for Integers
- Stack re-sizes array when necessary
- Implement void push(Integer val), Integer pop(), and
Integer peek(), int size() – returns the length
- Implement void sort() – you must write your own 
implementation of insertion sort for this. 
Using Arrays.sort() will not be accepted as a viable 
solution.
- Write a unit test to fill the Stack to 250% original 
capacity (resize method must automatically be called 
twice).
- Write unit tests for push(), pop(), and peek() 
to ensure stack behaves correctly.
- Add Javadoc style comments.
